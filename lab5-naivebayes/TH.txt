Family of simple "probabilistic classifiers"
-->based on bayes theorme
Advs---> requires a small number of training data to estimate the params necessary for classiication
BAyes Theorem -->
	P(A|B) = [ P(B|A)*P(A) ] / P(B)
P(A) ==> prior probablity
P(B) ==> marginal likelihood
P(B|A) ==> likelihood
P(A|B) ==> posterior likelihood

-->> its just the likelihood probabilty of the given data
